//9. Cascading API Calls
//Problem: Youâ€™re working on a travel booking app. First, you need to fetch available flights. Based on the flight selected, you fetch hotel availability, and finally, based on the hotel, you fetch the best car rental options. Each step depends on the previous one.
//
//Exercise: Write a coroutine chain where each API call depends on the result of the previous one. Use async and await or suspend functions to achieve this. Ensure proper error handling in case any API call fails.
